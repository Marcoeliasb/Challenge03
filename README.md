# Challenge03
The third challenge of the bootcamp

In order to solve this challenge:

Collecting Employee Data: The collectEmployees function was implemented to prompt the user for the first name, last name, and salary of each employee. Data is validated to ensure the salary is a valid number, then stored in an array of objects representing each employee.

Displaying Average Salary: The displayAverageSalary function was created to calculate the average salary of the employees and display this value along with the total number of employees in the console. To calculate the average salary, all employee salaries are summed up and divided by the total number of employees.

Selecting a Random Employee: The getRandomEmployee function randomly selects an employee from the array of employees and displays their full name in the console. This is achieved by generating a random index within the range of the array of employees and using this index to access the corresponding employee object.

In addition to these functions, some corrections were made in the original code to fix errors such as the incorrect use of forEach (written as foreach) and the incorrect reference to Math (written as math).
